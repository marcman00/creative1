<p style="margin-top:0px;">April Reynolds has worked for over 30 years with diverse groups of adults, teens and children. She has given hundreds of hours of lessons and speeches to help those individuals to learn the skills and mindsets to help them be successful. She is comfortable with her audiences and puts them at ease which helps them engage in the learning process. Her passion is for helping persons be their best self and to assist them in having a vision of how to move toward their goals.
</p><p>
She has served as the President for Clear Lake Communicators, a Toastmasters Club in Houston, Texas, and has placed in four different speech competitions.

April lives in League City, Texas with her husband and their testy, but loveable, rescued cat, Alice. April is the mother of five children and eight grandchildren.  She enjoys dancing with them, playing games with them and has even tried her hand at video games in order to humor them.  She enjoys taking pictures of flowers and other scenes from nature. She has found that her tropical backyard fills her spirit and gives her inspiration. She is well-known in her family for making colorful salads chock full of veggies, fruit and nuts. When time permits, she enjoys hiking with her husband, because both the hiking itself and the views they see en route are exhilarating!</p>
